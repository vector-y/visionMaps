# visionMaps

Welcome to `visionMaps`, a pioneering repository dedicated to transforming the way we interact with assembly instructions for furniture and other do-it-yourself projects. This repository hosts the codebase for an innovative application that presents visual instructions in a format similar to navigational aids like Google Maps. As users progress through the assembly steps, the app visually depletes the materials (screws, nails, etc.) to provide a clear and dynamic guide to completing their project.

## Overview

`visionMaps` is designed to enhance the experience of assembling products by offering an interactive, step-by-step visual guide that simplifies the process. The application is particularly suited for spatial computing devices, where it can leverage AR (Augmented Reality) to superimpose instructions onto the real-world environment, making the assembly process intuitive and engaging.

## Features

- **Visual Instruction Flow**: Like a navigation system for assembly, guiding users through each step with clarity.
- **Material Tracker**: Dynamically updated list of materials that depletes as the user progresses through the instructions.
- **Spatial Computing Integration**: Compatibility with AR and other spatial computing technologies to project instructions onto the physical workspace.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation through the assembly process.

## Installation

To set up `visionMaps` for development or usage, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vector-y/visionMaps.git
cd visionMaps
cd frontend && npm install & npm run dev
# Follow specific instructions for setting up the backend and frontend
