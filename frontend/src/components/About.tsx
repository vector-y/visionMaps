                                    Sleeve began in 2023 with a mission to reduce fashion waste from entering our beautiful beaches and landfills. Sustainable fashion is at the heart of our business as our goal is to help small to midsize fashion brands with their overstock by helping them sell out. We understand that clothing is expensive, so weâ€™re curating affordable fashion pieces that uniquely tell a story.
